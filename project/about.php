		<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I first want to thank you for visiting my blog! My name is Cathy and this blog started as an idea for a school project. I'm a college student from the USA and this
			is a blog dedicated to my favorite dramas and hope to provide my friends and family who are interested in Asian entertainment a good place to start. I wasn't born watching dramas
			and had to start somewhere. I hope I can suggest some series that are interesting to a new viewer and will inspire them to watch more series on their own.
			<br><br>
			<strong>So, how did I get started on dramas?</strong>
			<br><br>
			Well, I grew up in a family of mostly males who were huge fans of kung fu movies, manga (Japanese graphic novels), and anime (Japanese cartoon shows, typically based on 
			mangas). So for me, it was a natural progression to start watching Asian dramas as well, especially since the first few dramas I watched were live adaptations of some of my 
			favorite mangas.
			<br><br>
			I found out later that the number of good dramas based on mangas was significantly less than the ones not based on them. However, I had no idea where to start; there were too many! 
			It’s just like in America where there is a huge variety of American shows to appeal to the different interests of their potential viewers.
			<br><br>
			It wasn’t until I viewed the drama recommendations on a blog I frequently visited that I felt like I had a good place to start. That’s essentially what gave me the idea 
			for my own blog.
			<br><br>
			As of this moment, there are only about 10 drama and film series listed on this blog. I have seen and would recommend WAY more than 10 Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese series.
			For a complete list of series and movies I’ve seen, you’re more than welcome to check
			<a href="http://www.mydramalist.com/dramalist/JustTacos" target="_blank">My Drama List Page</a>. It’s the most up-to-date list of items I’ve seen and I usually update it 
			when I finish a series and watch new episodes.<br><br>
