It's about a man named Daikichi Kawachi who ends up becoming the controversial guardian of a young girl. Said girl happens to be the secret daughter of his deceased grandfather. On top of that, the family doesn't discover that the young girl even exists until the grandfather's funeral. Daikichi finds that he must quickly learn to balance being not only a new father, but also a single parent.|If there is a story about a character who has to mature in a short span of time because he/she is now responsible for a little one[s], I will probably find it and love it. The lead guy takes it upon himself to become the guardian to his aunt and it was totally cute watching him learn to change his life from being a bachelor to beoming a single dad.

However, there is little demand in the industry for songs of a happy-go-lucky nature and, effectually, little money, so Soichi ends up finding work in a musical genre with high demand, death metal. He finds that he has to go to extreme levels of hilarity to hide his alter-ego, the member of an extremely popular death metal group, from his friends, which is at such odds with his actual personality.|Interestingly enough, the lead actor of the more serious Usagi Drop plays the lead in this very funny film. I must admit that I watched this film just to watch him go from that role to this one where he's forced to be a death metal artist when he basically wants to sing songs fitting for Sesame Street.

They are about what happens in the lives of Chiaki and Nodame after they leave Japan and grow in their respective musical careers in Europe.|These films are just continuations of the drama and were still great at maintaining the same feeling that the dramas had. Things have gotten a bit more serious for the cast though (they've all gone on to be or try to be professional musicians), and as with all careers, it takes hard work. The soundtracks to these movies also continued my new love of classical music and it's great that a mainstream movie was able to do that.
