To be again reunited with their group of friends. The film switches back and forth between present day and the 1980s to show their antics together as teens.|While I will never know what it was like growing up in South Korea in the 80s and 90s, I love that they did this movie that shows the back story of these women as teens. Because of this film, Kang Sora quickly became one of my favorite Korean actresses and have watched a good portion of the films and movies she's been in. The entire younger cast did a great job and they've all gone on to work in other great products. I love going back and watching their start in this film.

In an effort to become the next biggest group, their music producers find a song written by a girl who was previously in their entertainment company 20 years prior. However, this girl was previously bullied by other girls in the company at the time and put a curse on the song.|I like this movie for a lot of reasons, but mostly because it stars a couple of my favorite Korean Pop singers. The story is average and borderline terrible, but this movie is plain and simply a guilty pleasure of mine.
